# Plantain Presidio

**Plantain Presidio** is a text-based adventure game where you try to escape an interconnected chamber by finding plantain chips, fighting enemies, and searching for heals.

Originally created by me and a friend, I recently tweaked, improved the code, and added more features for clarity and easier execution.
